#Phylogenetic Affinities
##Goal: Determine the phylogenetic placement of the new species.
###Step 1. Use Bayesian methods to analyze a partitioned (what), concatenated alignment of 5 nDNA loci.

###Step 2. Calculate the posterior probabilities of monophyly for the new species with: members that are geographically proximate, members that share ecomorphologically space, and that geographically proximate and ecomorphologically similar species.

#Ecomorphological Affinities
##Goal: Quantify the ecomorphological similarity of new species to other anoles
###Step 1. Calculate the Euclidean distance to every other species in a four-dimensional morphospace of traits.

###Step 2. Test whether the new species forms a distinct phenotypic cluster with a specific clade (Chamaeleinides) by conducting a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with 7 categories (1 represents the new species, 1 Chamaeleonides, then the remaining ecomorphs).
