#Ecomorphological Affinities
##Goal: Quantify the ecomorphological similarity of new species to other anoles
###Using pPCA Revell (2009) on a covariance matrix of log-transformed and averaged data for body size and 
###shape residuals with the Bayesian MCC chronogram they calculated independent "size" and "shape" axes.  
###load log-transformed and averaged data for body size and shape data 
```df <- "Traits.csv"
```
###load necessary packages for data tidying and transformation
```library(tidyverse)
```
###rename dataframe and read csv into a tibble
```traits <- read_csv(df, col_names = TRUE)
```
###see the variables in the tibble
```glimpse(traits)
```
###The data file they provided in Dryad contains 29 more species than the data table they produced so...
```m_sp_col <- read_csv("Mahler_species_col.csv", col_names = TRUE)
traits_2 <- read_csv("Traits_2.csv", col_names = TRUE)
traits_reduced <- m_sp_col %>% left_join(traits_2)
```
###load NEXUS tree file - they specify this NEXUS tree in their README file 
```tree <- read.nexus("5Loc_25milburn_100kthin.MCC.median.nex")
```
###The number of taxa in the data file and tree do not match
```tip_label <-tibble(tree$tip.label)
dropped_tips <- tip_label %>% 
anti_join(traits_reduced, c("tree$tip.label" = "species"))
```
###the above gives a dataset of 27 tips to drop from an OG data set of 97, leaving 70. Two sp are now missing in the morph set.
```missing_dropped_tips <- traits_reduced %>% 
  anti_join(tip_label, c("species" = "tree$tip.label"))
```
###centralis and guazuma appear to not be in the tree files but are reported in the loadings table for the pPCA in the paper.
###With this in mind I suppose I will continue with the analyses without the morph data for those species.

#tree<-(drop.tip(tree, dropped_tips))
#plot(tree)

###now we will remove missing data from the trait morph
```trait70sp <- traits_reduced %>% 
semi_join(tip_label, c("species" = "tree$tip.label"))
```
###Nevermind, found this in supplements: 
  #"Thus, for our comparative analyses, measurements of A. guazuma correspond to A. garridoi in the
  #phylogeny, and measurements of A. centralis correspond to A. terueli in the phylogeny"
```traits_3 <- read_csv("Traits_3.csv", col_names = TRUE)
traits_reduced <- m_sp_col %>% left_join(traits_3)
trait72sp <- traits_3 %>% 
  semi_join(tip_label, c("species" = "tree$tip.label"))
```
###load necessary package for phylogenetic PCA
```library(phytools)
```
###build the model of phylogenetic relationships to the covariance matrix of traits to determine if 
### covariance occurs at a rate greater than expected by Brownian Motion
```pPCA <- phyl.pca(tree, trait70sp, method="BM", mode="cov")
```
###visualize in screeplot the PCAs
```screeplot(pPCA)
scatter(pPCA, useLag=TRUE)
plot(pPCA, useLag=TRUE)
```
##Calculate the Euclidean distance to every other species in by the first four axes of a phylogenetic PCA on traits. 

##Conducted a 7-category linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on traditional ecomorph class for the four cryptic
giants in our sample (A. landestoyi, A. chamaeleonides, A. guamuhaya, A. porcus) plus
all species assigned to one of the six traditional ecomorph classes
